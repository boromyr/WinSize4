WinSize 4 is an application that moves and resizes windows after your settings. I want more control over where windows are located and sized that what Windows can offer.
I have since a long time used WinSize2, but that application is missing a few features and is not maintained since long.<br>

Later a WinSize3 has emerged, but that is also lacking some functionality, in my opinion.<br>

So I decided to make my own attempt, WinSize4.
