WinSize4 is an application that moves and resizes windows according to your settings. I want more control over where windows are located, and sized, that what Windows can offer.
I have since a long time used WinSize2, but that application is missing a few features and is not maintained since long.<br>

Later a WinSize3 has emerged, but that is also lacking some functionality, in my opinion.<br>

## WinSize4.
<br>
WinSize4 runs in the background consuming very little resources. Every time a window gets focus does it check its database if a window with the same criteria exists, and if so places and resizes it. The criteria is which executable that runs it and / or the title of the window, and which screen the window is on.
